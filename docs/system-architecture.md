# System Architecture - quantum-workbench

This document is the system-level architecture attachment for the repository. It keeps the technical stack, runtime boundary, data/control flow, deployment surface, and operating assumptions in one place.

## Architecture Summary

| Area | Design |
| --- | --- |
| Repository | `quantum-workbench` |
| Primary domain | governed analytics, data contracts, and decision intelligence |
| Primary stack | Python service or lab runtime, GitHub Actions validation |
| Architecture axes | cloud architecture, AI engineering, reliability, security, operator experience |

Repository-local proof surface for governed analytics, data contracts, and decision intelligence, backed by Python service or lab runtime, GitHub Actions validation.

## Runtime And Data Flow

    User["User or technical reviewer"] --> Surface["Public demo, CLI, package, or README surface"]

```

Primary domain: governed analytics, data contracts, and decision intelligence.

## Stack Surface

| Layer | Current surface | Operating note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interface | Public demo, README, CLI, package, or static proof surface depending on repository shape | Keep the first screen or command path inspectable without private credentials. |
| Runtime | Python service or lab runtime, GitHub Actions validation | Keep runtime adapters bounded by environment configuration and documented fallbacks. |
| Control plane | Policies, configuration, job orchestration, tests, and release scripts | Keep operator-impacting changes traceable through docs and validation hooks. |
| Data and artifacts | Fixtures, generated reports, screenshots, exports, logs, or model outputs | Keep sample and generated artifacts clearly separated from private or customer data. |
| Operations | CI, local validation, architecture guard, and handoff notes | Keep the architecture docs current when runtime, data, or deployment boundaries change. |

## Cloud Or Local Deployment Boundary

Operating model: contracted data zones, warehouse adapters, lineage capture, policy gates, and reproducible deployment modules

### Deployment patterns

- Data-contract lane with schema validation, lineage notes, and policy-aware analytics boundaries

### Control boundaries

- identity boundary and least-privilege service access
- environment separation for local, staging, and managed runtime paths
- secret storage outside source and deterministic fallback for missing credentials
- observability hooks for logs, metrics, traces, and audit events
- rollback path for deployment, schema, and model changes

### Resilience controls

- bounded retries with explicit failure states
- health/readiness checks before operator-facing flows are trusted
- idempotent data or artifact writes where repeat execution is possible
- cost and quota guardrails for hosted services and model adapters

## AI And Automation Boundary

Operating model: semantic query planning, schema-aware retrieval, forecast explanation, validation packs, and guarded natural-language interfaces

### Engineering patterns

- Bind natural-language interfaces to schema contracts, metric definitions, and query policy checks
- Expose lineage, freshness, and access posture before generated analytics are trusted
- Separate deterministic checks from model-generated output so the system remains testable without external credentials
- Capture prompts, inputs, outputs, and decision metadata as inspectable artifacts instead of hidden side effects
- Gate model-assisted actions with policy, confidence, and fallback states before they reach an operator path

### Evaluation and model-risk controls

- deterministic fixtures for CI-safe verification
- golden output or schema checks for generated artifacts
- trace capture for prompts, tool calls, inputs, and outputs
- quality gates that fail closed when evidence is missing

### Risks to keep explicit

- schema drift
- ungrounded analytics
- lineage gaps
- policy bypass
